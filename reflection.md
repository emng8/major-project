# Reflection

## What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?

- I would focus less on people able to draw the pipes to connect the dots. In my opinion, I spent too long trying to figure it out. Instead, I should have went to you earlier to figure out a solution. 

- I could have focused more on game mechanics and other important features that would have made the game more engaging.

- One area where I feel I could have done better is in the visuals of the game. I would have invested more time in enhancing the design elements instead of merely copying the layout from the original version. 

## Did you complete everything in your “needs to have” list?

- I was not able to send an error if the player is trying to connect two dots of different colors. This was because I could not draw the pipes/lines/rectangles due to the issues I discussed with you during our check-in. 

- I did not increase the amount of colored dots as the levels got harder. The reason why I did not do this is because I realized that keeping the same four colored dots would make the level harder. The reason for this is because with fewer dots, there are more possible pathways to fill the grid. 

- I completed everything else on my "needs to have" list. This includes a start page with a play button, completed level screen, making five game levels, music that plays during the game, and not allowing the path of one dot to cross over another. These key features created a solid foundation for the game’s core mechanics and player engagement.

## What was the hardest part of the project?

- Detecting when the mouse passes over a different colored dot was the most difficult part. It was difficult because it involved understanding the interactions between the grid, dots, and the mouse's position. 

## Were there any problems you could not solve?

- Drawing the pipes/rectangles/lines was the only part I could not figure out. This was what I talked to you about when we met with you to discuss our projects. It proposed a challenge because the paths had to be drawn in real-time. They were also supposed to be able to stop the path if the user attempts to cross a different color path.
