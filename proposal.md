# Project Description

For my major project, I would like to create the game Flow Free in Javascript using p5.js. 
In this one player game, you have to connect all the colored dots that are identical to each together. 


## Needs to Have List 

- start page with play button
- music that plays during the game
- a completed level screen
- different colored dots that connect with each other using the mouse
- can detect and send an error if the player is trying to connect two different colored dots
- at least five different game levels
    - at the beginning, the grid will be smaller and have less dots to connect
    - as the game level increases, the grid will become larger and have more dots to connect

## Nice to Have List

- create ten different game levels
- keeps track of how many moves you made to match all the colored dots to each other
- sound effects for when you are connecting the dots together
